file_system6.py

"file_system6.py" runs on Linux (Ubuntu or Kali) and needs sudo privileges.

This was a project for an OS class in Fall 2022.  I wrote the program "file_system6.py" myself. The objective of the project was to write a file system program with LDAP functionality, with the ability to download files from an LDAP server.  Encryption will be added using LDAPS.  



sslserver

The program "sslserver" was an another part of the same project where I combined my logging system from "file_system" with my partners' SSL socket.  The sslsocket's client was meant to be combined with "file_system6.py".  My partners wrote the "client" and I assisted with the "sslserver". However, we ran out of time that semester and did not finally combine the programs.  One of the problems we had is that with the "sslserver" and "client", we could only get them to run in Windows; also we had difficulty using LDAP, so a socket was used instead.
